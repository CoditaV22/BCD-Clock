- Using the internal RTC of a STM32 Nucleo board I  transmitted the date and time RealTerm using UART communication
- Now I am planning to make a binary clock on a breadboard using LEDs that light up based on the BCD value of the time.
- Afterwards I will want to make an alarm that goes off after a configurable time and implement a tamper detection in the code.
