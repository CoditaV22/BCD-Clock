- Using the internal RTC of a STM32 Nucleo board I transmitted time to RealTerm using UART communication. This happens in a SysTick Timer ISR.
- The user can also check the date by pressing 1 when terminal is connected. This is implemented with the use of UART_RX interrupts
- After reading the BCD Value of the RTC , the GPIO function sets the OD and MODE Registers for the GPIOs connected to the breadboard LEDs
- **Demonstration:** https://youtube.com/shorts/DG651NfuiZQ
- Now I will want to make an alarm that goes off after a configurable time , the possibility of setting up a timer and implement a tamper detection in the code.
